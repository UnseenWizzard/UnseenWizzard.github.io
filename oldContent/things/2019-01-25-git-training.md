title: Teach git concepts not commands

Git is a distributed version control system. And one that offers some incredibly powerful tools, once you've understood how to use it. 

But as Rachel Carmena correctly points out in a [blog post](https://rachelcarmena.github.io/2018/12/12/how-to-teach-git.html) a colleague recently shared with me, people are generally not introduced to git by being taught its concepts, but its basic commands. 

At the company I work at we switched from SVN to git, after a few developers - myself included - advocated for the switch. 

I have seen the post-its reminding you to `add -> commit -> push` Rachel writes of. 

I know colleagues that have long dreaded rebasing. 

So while we managed to convince people to switch to git, we failed to share our understanding of the core concepts in a way that allows them to comfortably utilize the powerful features of git, because they understand how and why they work and not just how to call the right commands. 

Based on the idea put forward in the blog post, and using [git challenges](https://www.slideshare.net/raquelmorenocarmena/git-challenges) referenced at the end of it, I've started to put together the following guide, putting the general concept into a concrete training session. 

At the time of this post it's still a work in progress, but I intend to finish it soon, and after that keep it updated with any feedback from the online version and a planned in house training session at incubedIT.
