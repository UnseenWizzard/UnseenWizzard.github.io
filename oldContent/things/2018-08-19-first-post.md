title: Personal Website/Blog attempt 3

After my second attempt at a free personal website and blog was met with the usual fate of sites with free hosting providers and is gone now, this is attempt #3.

As the first attempt was a way to try out a lightweight css framework (skeleton) but lacked content as it was just html pages, and the second was completely lost because it was a hosted wordpress blog, attempt three is hosted as a github page and done using Jekyll and spectre css. 

We'll see where this goes.
