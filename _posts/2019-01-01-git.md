Seeing some colleagues struggle using `git` and reading a great article with a differnt idea on teaching git, 
I've written a tutorial intended to help people understand some key git concepts, instead of memorzing commands. 

[Read and do it on github](https://github.com/UnseenWizzard/git_training) or [dev.to](https://dev.to/unseenwizzard/learn-git-concepts-not-commands-4gjc)
